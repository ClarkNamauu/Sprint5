# Overview

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C# language.}
The program that I wrote to demonstrate the C#language was a beginning to a dating story adventure game called BYU-I-DO where you go through a few sceneros and you choose where you go until you hit a script to wait until the next chapters come out.

I wrote this to freshen up on C# since it has been a whil since I have coded in C# and it allowed me to keep up my practice and skills.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

Used Progammz to run the code since was having some trouble running the code on Vscode. VsCode to save the file and to be able to upload. C# is the language that I used to code in.
